# ibm hangul recognition in keras
src: https://github.com/IBM/tensorflow-hangul-recognition

The original code has been written in tensorflow version 1, which my team found to be dull to understand. (Plus, for some unknown reasons, it seem the code is not so compatible with the current tensorflow version. You can find the original code in the folder '/retired')

So, we decided to interpret the overall framework of the code and convert it to a keras code for enhanced clarity.
